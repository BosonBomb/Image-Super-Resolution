# Image Super Resolution 

This repository implements the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) based on the paper by Xintao Wang et al. Below are the key features and components implemented:

- **RRDB Architecture**: Utilizes the Residual in Residual Dense Block (RRDB) for feature extraction and super-resolution tasks.

- **Relativistic GAN**: Implements the relativistic GAN framework to enhance the stability and quality of generated images.

- **VGG19 Feature Loss**: Incorporates the VGG19 architecture for perceptual loss calculation, enhancing visual quality by aligning generated images with high-level features of reference images.

- **Pixel Shuffler**: Based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158
